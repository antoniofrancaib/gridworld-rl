===== Optimal SARSA Parameters =====
Learning rate (α): 0.5
Exploration rate (ε): 0.01
Number of episodes: 1000
Maximum steps: 200
Average return: -7.50

These parameters were determined by a grid search over 81 combinations of hyperparameters.
They were automatically applied to all subsequent SARSA and Expected SARSA experiments.
